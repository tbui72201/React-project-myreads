Udacity FEND MyReads Project

# MyReads Overview

In this application, the main page displays a list of "shelves" (i.e. categories), each of which contains a number of books. The three shelves are:

 - Currently Reading
 - Want to Read
 - Read

Each book has an option that lets you select the shelf for that book. When you select a different shelf, the book moves there. Note that the default value for the shelf should always be the current shelf the book is in. 

# MyReads Find Books 

You can click on the Search link (+) from the main page to open the search page. The search page has a text input that allows to find books by author or title and let you add the book to your library. You can also move a book to a different shelf from the search page.
